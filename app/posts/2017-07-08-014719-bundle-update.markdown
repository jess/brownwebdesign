Bundle update can many be the cause of a splitting headache. A lesser
known fact is that when you run `bundle update GEMNAME` bundler will
actually update GEMNAME and all of GEMNAME's dependancies. And this of
course can lead to a much higher chance of conflicts.

Checkout the video to see what I mean:

<div class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe width="560" height="315"

allowfullscreen></iframe> </div>

Give this a try next time you need to 'update' a gem. For more detail,
