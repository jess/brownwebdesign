I just recently attended Grok. I'm not a big conference goer, but I've
attended [LessConf][] several times and a few ruby conferences.
Sometimes I always wonder why people go to conferences and how they
justify the expense. As an independent consultant, I'm always trying to
figure if my money and time was well spent.  I once heard another
consultant say "how can you not afford to attend conferences."

They're not cheap.  Grok was inexpensive as far as conferences go.
Here's my expense summary:

    Ticket:    $ 200
    Hotel:     $ 600
    Gas:       $ 100
    Dining:    $ 150
    Misc:      $  50
    Lost Work: $1500 # 2 days x 6hrs day billing @ 125hr
    --------------
    Total:     $2600

Now this is a real expense for me.  My bank account will be $2600 lower
had I not gone to this conference. That's a small marketing expense for
GitHub or Pardot, but a much larger % of my bottom line. That's a nice
MBP or almost a new bike! So was it worth it? I don't know the answer to
that question so I want list some reasons why I go.

#### 1. Fun

I work from home and don't typically get to hang out with people who do
creative technology stuff like I do. Spending time with them and getting
to chat about the latest cool thing is awesome.

It's fun to travel.

Conferences also do cool things like schedule us to drive high
performance BWM's!

#### 2. Learn

You learn lots of things a conferences. It's not always technical. It
could be things about teamwork, process, sales, or all sorts of stuff.
You get to talk about *what everyone's talking about* and be a part of the
conversation.

Grok is especially good at this.  They have 10/20's where you get to
split up into groups and have relevant meaningful discussions.

#### 3. People

The people has to be one of the biggest reasons you go to a conference.
You get to reacquaint with friends and people you've met from other
conferences. You get to meet heroes, people that inspire you, people
you've been following on twitter for years, but never met.

Some of the best experiences you have are meeting people that you didn't
know existed. I love meeting new and interesting people and it always
makes me a little sad when I see photos of photos after the conference
of people I didn't even get the chance to meet.

#### 4. Business / Networking

There is a business reason for me to going. My hope is that by meeting
people and making friends and connections, I'll be in a position
someday to help them solve a problem or build something really great.  I
hope that I can be at least close enough in people's circles that if
they have a need for web / rails developer, they might remember that
nice good looking (ok that's a stretch :-) guy they met and consider me.  

#### 5. Inspiration

There's usually a keynote speaker or two there by design to deliver
inspiration. At Grok this year, for me, it was [Kristian Anderson][]. 

He talked about the misguidance of following you passion. My take on it
was while you should do something you enjoy, you shouldn't do it just
because you enjoy it.  No matter how much I want to be a pro cyclist, it
isn't going to happen. You have to do what you're built for and also
what you're willing to suffer (ie what real passion means) for. 

This hit home for me because as a designer and developer, I struggle
with the thought that I should strive to be great at one or the other.
But I know I can never be the next Matthew Smith or Aaron Patterson, but
put the two together and mix in a little business smarts and I
might have something unique to offer.

You can always find little takeaways like that to bolster your confidence
and help you focus on what you're willing to suffer for.


#### 6. Getaway with Wife

Most conferences I go to my wife comes with me and my kids do not. It's
a great opportunity to spend a few days (my kids are young so we don't
stay gone long) away. She doesn't usually go to the conference, but
she'll come with me to the dinners and hangouts.

### Not all bliss

Despite all of the positives, I'd be remiss if I didn't say there are
hurtles as well. Besides the financial cost, mixing and mingling can
be extremely difficult for some. I figure I fit more in the "outgoing"
category and I still have a ton of insecurities. This is no reflection
on Grok or any other tech conference. In my experience, they're always
fantastic. The problem is our fears.

Logically thinking, I believe I'm a cool guy, have a pretty wife, a
successful business, am friendly, and am experienced at what I do, but
emotionally, I have a ton of insecurities at conferences.  I worry that
I won't be cool enough, or that I people won't like me. I worry that
people will not want to talk with me if I walk up to them, or that they
wished they'd sat beside someone else. I stress about why people don't
follow me back on twitter or ask me to dinner too. I wonder why people
don't take photos with me or mention me in their feed.

I was expressing these to my wife one night and she said, most
of the others have them too. I suppose she's right. Regardless, it's just
a part of being human, putting yourself out there and being willing to
make yourself venerable. Without doing that, you'd never get to enjoy all
of the positive experiences and meet so many cool people. So if you feel
a little like I do, just remember, others feel the same way.

### Summary

All in all it's a great experience. Grok was exceptional and I already
know I'll be back next year. Hopefully the relationships I rekindled and
started will evolve further.  Hopefully several cool projects will come
my way via a referral from a fellow groker!

So, my final conclusion is: conferences are worth it. You can't go to
them all, but selectively choose at least several a year to attend and
it'll be worth your trip!
