title: You Can Blog Too!

This evening I attended a local design meetup called
TransformAthens.  The topic was [Blogging and Your Future][2] and the
presenter was [John Saddington][3].  John is a well known proponent for
blogging and was there to encourage us to either start a blog or keep one going.

I [ recently started blogging ][4] and have found it to be much easier
than I figured it would be.  First I worried, *What would I write
about*?  I didn't realize this at first, but the more I learn, the more I
realize that a lot of blogging is simply about sharing your experiences.
As a rails and web developer, I have learning experiences every day.
So I decided that whenever I learn something new, I'll blog
about it.  So anytime now that I have to look something up or
research an issue, I'll open up Evernote and make a few notes, save the
urls or code snippets I used, and save it for later on.  Then, at a set
aside time, I'll write a blog post about it.  Sometimes, if it's going
to be a quick post, I'll just stop working on the client work and crank
out the blog. I've been doing that for about the past month.

### Ok, you're writing, but will anyone read it?
#### Will it help anyone?

The other day, I recorded a screencast of me setting up a [ refinery cms
rails app and deploying to heroku ][5] and published it to my blog.  A
few days later, I had the idea to send the post to Peter Cooper who
publishes a popular Ruby newsletter called [Ruby
Weekly](http://rubyweekly.com/).  I didn't think there was any way he'd
publish it, but today Ruby Weekly was released and I about jumped
through the roof when I saw he published a link to my post.  

So there you have it...what John says is true, you really have no
excuse.  If you can hit the publish button, you can start and maintain a
blog and it'll reward you.  

I hope my small experience of a quick success story of starting a blog,
actually publishing some posts and getting it picked up by a popular
industry newsletter helps.  I'm a believer!

#### Update:

[ Matt Smith ][matt] posted a much better recap of the meetup here and listed some
of the major points John made in his talk.  [ Go check it out ][mattblog]!
