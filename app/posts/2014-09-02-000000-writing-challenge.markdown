Yesterday I was out on a bike ride with my friend Matt Smith and he
told me he'd been [challenged][2] to write a blog post every business day for
the next 30 days. He didn't call me out like the Ice bucket challenge,
but he asked if I wanted to do it too. So I accepted. 

At the beginning of this year I decided I *really* wanted to write more.
I'd read about numerous people like [Nathan Berry][3] writing 1000 words
daily or [John Saddingon's][4] obsession with blogging and decided I wanted
it to be a part of what I do. So I thought I'd take some time and figure
out why should I write?

## Why Write?

#### 1. To get better at it

I've never been great at writing. I've always been better at Math than
Reading/Writing (my math score nearly doubled my English sore on my
SAT's). I realise I don't have a natural ability to write, but I believe
it is something you can vastly improve on if you practice at it. Writing
and communication is critical in any career, but I believe as much or more
so than anywhere it's critical in software development.

#### 2. To Learn

Whenever I write something I'm able to turn a lot of incomplete ideas
and thoughts into something meaningful and organized. If it's a
technical post where I'm explaining something I've built or designed,
then I learn even more than what I did when I first built it. 

#### 3. To Teach

It's also an opportunity to teach. I met Dr. Maya Angelou once and had
dinner with her in her apartment. One of my favorite quotes from her is
***When you get, give. When you learn teach.*** I've learned so much
from others sharing what they know. I've literally gained a 2nd education
from the internet. I'm hoping to just pass a little on!

#### 4. To inspire creativity

To write is a creative process and I believe it just breeds more
creativity. I'm the most creative when I'm writing often. I'm more
creative as a developer, designer, marketer...just all around. 

#### 5. To be more open

I hope that by being open, honest, communicative, and sharing more about
my life that I'll meet more people, build better relationships, and
enable clients to be more comfortable because they already know a
little about who I am and how I think, how I operate, and what to
expect. 

#### 6. Opportunity

Hopefully my writing will bring an audience and an audience will bring
opportunities. Whether through client work or partnership opportunities
or my next business partner, writing can bring opportunity in the door.

## Summary

This isn't meant to be an exhaustive list, but the top reasons on my
mind right now.

What are some others?
