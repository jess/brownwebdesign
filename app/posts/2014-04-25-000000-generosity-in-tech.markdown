title: Generosity In Tech

I recently spoke at [Tech Talent South][1] which is a school that
teaches an intensive course on Ruby on Rails. Most of them were not only
new to rails, but were also starting a career as a developer in the tech
industry.  

My presentation was about independent consulting and how I make a living
doing it. I shared a lot of things I was a little uncomfortable sharing
(income, struggles, advantages, disadvantages, etc). 

I'm not quite sure why I was chosen to speak, but my reasoning for going
was I wanted to do what I could to help others...just as so many have
helped me in my career.  During the presentation I spoke about
generosity and giving back and how awesome our industry is at sharing
and helping others.

I've never seen another industry that shares like we do.  Our sharing
through open source ([Rails][]), blogging, ([Rails Tips][]), teaching
([Rails Tutorial][]), willingness to help one another with a
troubling issue ([Pair With Me][]), conference speakers ([Ben
Orenstein][]), screencasts ([RailsCasts][]), sponsors ([Mailchimp][]),
workshops ([LessMoney][]), organizations ([RailsGirls][]) and more.
Startup incubators like [Atlanta Tech Village][] and [FourAthens][]
continually echo the idea of **paying it forward**. These are just a very
small set of examples that are close to me. There are tons and tons
more.

When I first got into this industry, I always wondered why people would
share something so valuable. Why would people give away their secrets,
knowledge, and experience for others to profit?

I recently read a [blog post][2] by Seth Godin about Generosity.  It may be
the best way to answer the question. It was so short and sweet, I can
quote it here:

> ### The generosity boomerang
>
> Here's conventional wisdom:
> 
> *Success makes you happy. Happiness permits you to be generous.*
> 
> In fact, it actually works like this:
> 
> *Generosity makes you happy. Happy people are more likely to be
> successful.*

I really believe that is how it is within technology circles, especially
on the creative side of things. Technology people are generous, they are
happy and they are successful.

I'm reminded of an acronym we have in Christianity: JOY. It goes like
this...*The path to Joy is focusing on*

    J-esus  
    O-thers  
    Y-ou  

I expect other religions have a parallel idea. Whichever way you look at
it, there's a connection between helping others, happiness, and success.
**What are you waiting for...Go be generous!**
