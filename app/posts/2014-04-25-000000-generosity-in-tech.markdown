title: Generosity In Tech

I recently spoke at an event called [Tech Talent South][1] which is a
school that teaches an intensive course on Ruby on Rails. Most of them
were not only new to rails, but were also starting a career in as a
developer in the tech industry.  

My presentation was about independent consulting and how I make a living
doing it. I shared a lot of things I was a little uncomfortable sharing
(income, struggles, advantages, disadvantages, etc). One of the things I
told them was how awesome our industry is, especially with regards to
sharing and generosity. I've never seen another industry that shares
like we do.  Our sharing through open source ([Rails][]), blogging,
([Rails Tips][]), teaching ([Rails Tutorial][]), willingness to help one
another at with a troubling issue ([Pair With Me][]), conference
speakers ([Ben Orenstein][]), screencasts ([RailsCasts][]), sponsors
([Mailchimp][]), workshops ([LessMoney][]), organizations
([RailsGirls][]) and more. This is just a spec of examples that are
close to me. There are tons and tons more.

When I first got into this industry, I always wondered why people would
share something so valuable. Why would people give away their secrets,
knowledge, experience?

I recently read a blog post by Seth Godin about Generosity.  It was so
short and sweet, I can quote it here:

> ### The generosity boomerang
>
> Here's conventional wisdom:
> 
> *Success makes you happy. Happiness permits you to be generous.*
> 
> In fact, it actually works like this:
> 
> *Generosity makes you happy. Happy people are more likely to be
> successful.*

I really believe that is how it is within technology circles,
especially the creative side of things. Technology people are generous,
they are happy and they are successful.

I'm reminded of an acronym we have in Christianity: JOY. It goes like
this:  The path to Joy is focusing on 

    J-esus  
    O-thers  
    Y-ou  

Whichever way you slice it, there's a connection between helping others,
happiness, and success. What are you waiting for...Go be generous!
