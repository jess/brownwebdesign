On Friday's while Patty is at CrossFit, I usually take a break from work
and watch Nate for a few hours. This morning I asked him what he wanted
to do and he said, "I want to see a train". Ok, that's a random one, how
do I fulfil that request?

Well, while out cycling the other day, I just happened to ride by a CSX
station in a town nearby, so we hopped in the car and drove out to it.
It was an old building with no windows or glass in the door, but I
knocked and when no one answered I just went in. It was a very non
public place with lockers and years old flooring and walls. Once inside
though I bumped into a man with an earring and ponytail and just said,
"hi, we'd like to see a train, are there any out in the yard we can look
at?"

He was very accommodating and took us out in the yard and showed us all
kinds of stuff: tracks, cars, engines, a choo-choo-truck; he even blew
the train horn! It's amazing what people are willing to share
with you if you just ask!

I've done this quite a few times, with fire stations, police stations,
etc. We have a small local airport that I took the kids to once. We
walked into the mechanics shop, and struck up a conversation with the
first person we saw. It turns out he owns one of the planes in the shop
and invites the kids up into the plane and answers all kids of random
questions from the kids.

The owner of the shop even ended up giving the kids some wooden model
airplanes. 

### Just Ask

I was chatting with a business assiciate the other day and we were
talking about this concept of ***asking***. Whether you're thinking of
asking for a sale, for the job, for an investment, for the
promotion...just don't be afraid to ask. I typically find people are
much more willing to entertain the idea that you think they might be.
Even if they're not, it may open the doors to something else. Besides,
the worst thing that can happen is you get a No, and that's not a bad risk
to reward ratio!
