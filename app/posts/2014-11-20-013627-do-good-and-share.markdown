title: Do Good And Share With Others

This morning during my quiet / devotion / reflection time, I came across
[this Bible devotional][1]. The focal point was a bible verse, [Hebrews
13:16](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews13:16&version=niv)
that simply says: "*remember to be good and share with others*".

It's such a simple concept and yet...

I like to post things like this to help me remember. Sometimes it's just
a postit note, or sometimes it's a framed calligraphy, but this time I
wanted to make a desktop and iPhone wallpaper and like the verse says,
"share it." 

The font I used was [Tablet Gothic Compressed][2] from Typekit.

Here's the desktop version. Click to get the hi res version.

<div class="columns large-10 large-centered">
<p><%= link_to image_tag("http://brownwebdesign.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-background-heb13-16.jpg"), "http://brownwebdesign.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-background-heb13-16-hi-res.jpg" %></p>
</div>

<p>Here's the iPhone version:</p>

<div class="columns large-8 large-centered">
<p><%= link_to image_tag("http://brownwebdesign.s3.amazonaws.com/images/iphone-screen-background-heb13-16.jpg"), "http://brownwebdesign.s3.amazonaws.com/images/iphone-screen-background-heb13-16-hi-res.jpg" %></p>
</div>
