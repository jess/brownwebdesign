Ok wait, I'll explain...

My wife Patty got some kind of free essential oil sample in the mail the
other day. It had some fancy phrases all over the packaging like,
*Certified Pure Therapeutic Grade*. 

Patty didn't know what it was or what it was used for so she starting
Goggling it and came across a [website][] that sort of *exposed* this
company and their claims. It turns out that *Certified Pure Therapeutic
Grade* is actually just a registered trademark of the company and has
nothing do with the quality of the product. It's a marketing phrase
they registered. 

I know companies make all kind of false claims and weave the truth
between and around regulations, but this is the first I've heard of
trademarking a phrase in this way. 

No wonder social media is such a strong influencer of buying decisions.
People know they cannot trust a company's own claims, so they rely on
someone they know who has experienced the product or service. 

So, should I trademark *only certified rails developer in Georgia*? :)
