I recently had to setup a refinery cms on heroku for a client so I
decided to record it and share.

I recorded this at about 1280px wide, so you'll likely get a much
clearer picture if you view on [ Vimeo ](https://vimeo.com/86460002) where they allow a better quality
verion.

Let ne know if you have any questions.
