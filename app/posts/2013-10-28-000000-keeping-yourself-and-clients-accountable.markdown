### The Problem

Ever since I started out on my own as a web developer, I've found it
difficult to manage projects.  I don't feel like I'm necessarily
terrible at it (my previous job involved managing IT, Marketing, and Sales of a
3+ million small business). There's a couple of things usually get me
off schedule:

1. **Short term time requirements** This includes modifying/adding/fixing a
   recently launched project or a 1-2 hr need for an existing client.  It's
something most clients consider reasonable and expect to be done within 2-5
days.
2. **Ballers**  Clients that are really visible, vocal and on the ball about their project.  I typically like these clients (as long as they're never pushy or rude) because they keep me moving.  However, these folks make it easy to forget about the previously scheduled project and focus on theirs.


### What does this leave?  
This typically leaves out the client who has a ton of other things going
on within their business and haven't held you to any timeline.  These guys
usually get passed over for #1 and #2.


### Background Story

Just recently I got a dreaded email from a client.  To sum it up, they
wanted their deposit back and wanted to move on to another developer.
**Ouch!** That really heart my pride and professional opinion of myself.
Fortunately we've been really busy so the loss of business isn't as
hurtful, but it was a project I was actually looking forward to working
on and with a company I wanted to make a decent impression on.  Plus I
was embarrassed and had a major case of regret.

### What happened?
First, I admit to all fault.  It's my responsibility of starting the
project, setting expectations and moving the project along.

It was a project that was slow to come together.
We started discussing ideas around the first of the year, I sent them an
estimate around Feb, we agreed on price around May and I got a check
around late June.

By this time I'd had several other larger sized projects come in as
well, which put me booked quite a long ways out (Oct / Nov).  

This is where my (and a lot of projects) get off to a bad start:
*knowing when you can start*.  I hate to displease people. The last
thing people want to hear after they just cut you a check is that you
can't start for some-long-period-of-time.  And the truth is, in our line
of work, there's no possible way to determine a project's length, the end
date, and the start of the next one.  Building software is tough, and most
good software projects will go through several iterations, with many changes,
and sometimes you wind up with something much different than what you
thought you'd have in the beginning (this is a good thing for the
business).  

It's kinda difficult to explain my contact / point person's position on
the project, but he wasn't in the typical position of a client (owner,
CEO, CTO, etc).  He also wasn't the kind of person to call and check in
on things or get updates that often.  I'm not in any way blaming him,
but it made it super easy for me to tend to #1 and #2.  


### What works for me

During this same year, I started working with 2 really good clients that
I've come to respect ([CongrueIt](http://www.congrueit.com) and [Nexchain](http://www.nexchaind.com)).  Two of the guys with CongrueIT have been in the IT consulting industry field for some time and the guy with Nexchain has been all over the world managing projects.

The one thing they expected of me was constant communication.  While working on a phase or iteration for
their project, we'd typically chat and/or screen share 1-2 times per
week.  This would include *before*, during and even after the iteration
was complete.  Reading this, you'd probably think, duh, you have to
communicate, but in reality, good intentions are always there. However, busy
schedules, getting behind, etc, make it difficult to actually follow through.

So the solution for me is now a mandatory weekly call from clients.  I
ask my clients to hold me accountable to keeping the phone call,
providing updates, and keeping the project on tract.  Likewise, I hold them
accountable for keeping the call, providing feedback, and staying active
in the project (this helps the money side of things too :-)

Open, honest, frequent, and regular/scheduled communication is the way to go.  If you're not doing it, I encourage you start today.
