& Go"

I guess this is true with any business, but it's still fustrating to
have ups and down's in a business. Running a small consulting business,
I frequently only focus on moving the business forward.  I have X number
of projects that I'm working on, deadlines, goals for number of hours
billed in a week, etc.  The problem is, we're usually only ever
anticipate things going perfect...best case scenario.  However, we know
that Murphy's law likes to inject itself into our workflow from time to
time and things never go as we anticipate.  

Just this past week, I had a string of several setbacks:

1. [My server wouldn't reboot](/blog/2013/11/25/back-everything-up)
2. I switched DNS for a client and the mail quit working (this later
   turned out not to be a result of my DNS change)
3. My wife got the stomach bug and I had to take the day off to watch
   our kids
4. Thanksgiving Holidays (not really a setback, but 2 more days things
   aren't getting done)
