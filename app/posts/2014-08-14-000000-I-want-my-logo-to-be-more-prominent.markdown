title: I want my logo to be more prominent

I try not to rant too much, but I'm going to let a little one loose. 

I can't tell you how many times I've heard *I think my logo needs to be
a little more prominent* or *I'd like my logo to be more noticible* or
*our logo should be larger*.

Why?

When have you gone to a doctor's office and felt better after seeing a
logo? When have you gone to a restaurant and been better served or had
your appetite satisfied after noticing the logo on the menu? Do you
donate to one charity over another because they have a cool logo? If you
walk into a bank to get information on a loan, do you want to hear about
the bank or about the how they can help you with a loan? 

While it may stroke your ego, a large logo won't increase your sales.
Left too large, it can actually waste valuable selling space.  Logos and
brand identity are important, but making your logo larger isn't going to
magically increase your brand awareness. People come to your site to
find information relevant to them. Can you help them solve a problem,
make something more enjoyable, save them money? Your visitor wants to
know what you can do for them. Your logo is probably not going to be
able to tell them this.

If I roll back the covers on my rant, I think my issue is with more than
just a logo's size. It's about clear communication, focused intention,
and actionable requests. It's about putting [people first][3] and really
digging deep on what makes you (or your company ) unique and valuable.

#### Finishing my thoughts on on logo size

I wanted to see if I was alone in my thinking, so I did this web search:

[how big should my logo be on my website][1]

The [first article][2] is basically taking my stance and offers a few nice
stats on logo sizes:

- Nordstrom (191 x 24)
- McDonalds (113 x 98)
- Starbucks (84 x 84)
- Wall Street Journal (362 x 30)
- Nick Jr. (219 x 58)
- Verizon (118 x66)

These are *small*

What do you think? Any ideas or rules of thumb for logo size on a
website?
