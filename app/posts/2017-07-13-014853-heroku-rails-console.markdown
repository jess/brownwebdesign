The rails console was one of the parts of rails that I quickly fell in
love with. Quickly being able to run your app's code and access the
database from a CLI was very empowering.

If you're debugging code, checking data, or running impromptu reports,
the rails console is your goto tool.

If you need to do something with the data you're querying from the
console and it's a lot of data, you may wish to save it to a file and
this can be not-so-straight forward on Heroku.

Checkout the below video and let me know what you think:
