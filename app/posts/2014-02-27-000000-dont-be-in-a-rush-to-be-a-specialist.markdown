## Specialization

Over the course of several years, I've heard a lot about becoming a
specialist in my industry (web development).  Many people focus on
design, some focus on front-end development, some focus on backend
frameworks.  Many people even take that further.  Some designers only
design for iOS and some only for the entertainment industry.  Some front
end developers specialize in SASS or Javascript frameworks.  Some rails
developers specialize in big data or geospatial intelligence.

## What do I specialize in?

This March will be my 6th year in business. I've been trying to redesign
my website and rewrite copy and the message I want people to know about
what I do. It's got me thinking:  *Shouldn't I be a specialist?*

## UX Thursday: The Rise of the...

I was listening to [Jared Spool][] speak at a recent event called [UX
Thursday][].  He made some great points about the intent of design
throughout the talk, but some of the things he said towards the end
really resonated with me.  Let me give you a brief background.

The title of the talk was *It's a great time to be a designer*, and
towards the end he said that after all these years of trying to
convince companies that design matters, they were finally listening.
But now suddenly, we (as designers) have to back up the talk.  He read
an old Chinese proverb: "Be careful what you ask for, lest it become so". 

The problem now is finding good designers.  Jared's company does
research and helps companies attract and retain good designers. During a
recent study, they asked many design team managers: *What skills are
found in the best design teams?* What he got back was quite a large list
of skills.  Then trying to narrow the scope, he asked, **What separates
out the best designers?** He was expecting a single skill or
characteristic that set apart great designers from others (remember his
goal is to find the best designers ...if he could hone in on this one
important skill, he'd be able to seek them out and recommend them for
hire).  Well, what he got back was this:

<span class="footnote">Slide from Jared's Talk</span>

When I saw this, I remember being overwhelmed and thinking, if I was
looking for a UX job, I might just get up and walk out, because I'll
never be great at all those things.

Then Jared presented his thesis of the presentation:  **The Rise of The
UX Generalist**. Let's explore some terms:

<%= image_tag "blog/generalist.jpg", alt: "Slide by Jared Spool" %>
<span class="footnote">Slide from Jared's Talk</span>

He wasn't saying that being a specialist was bad, but being a
compartmentalist was.  Also, to be a specialist, you need to first be a
generalist. He used an analogy of being a hand surgeon and showed how
this particular hand surgeon was a general surgeon for many years before
he became a specialist. Being a specialist didn't mean he wasn't good at
any of the other types of surgery, it just meant he was a better at
hand surgery. 

**So what's the moral?**  For me it was you can't choose to
not be good at many things and only try to focus on one
speciality...they're all to intertwined. I have a feeling there are a
lot of compartmentalist designers and developers out there, for it's
easy to ignore one some areas and only focus on a few. The ***best***
will be good at many skills, and some who have been well rounded for a
long time may become a specialist over time.

## Seth Godin says be a...

I've been rereading Linchpin.  If you're not familiar with the book,
it's about breaking out of a factory mindset where jobs are broken down
into specific tasks and become part of an assembly line in a factory.
Instead he seeks to introduce us to the *Linchpin*.  A Linchpin is
someone who can bring it together and make a difference, someone who
thinks outside the box, an artist: someone with a genius for finding a
new answer, a new connection, or a new way of getting things done.

The point of the book is that great work doesn't come from perfection
and it certainly doesn't come from being average, but it comes from
solving problems that people haven't predicted and for which no job
description exists. He talks about [Marissa Mayer][]:

> Marissa has created billions of dollars' worth of value in her time at
> Google.  Yet she's not the key brain in the programming department,
> nor is she responsible for finance or even public relations.  Marissa
> is a Linchpin.  She applies artistic judgement combined with emotional
> labor. 

Marissa led the way in Google's now-cherished user interface. Is/was she
a specialist?  Here's an excerpt from her wikipedia page:

> During her 13 years with the company, she was an engineer, designer,
> product manager and executive. Mayer held key roles in Google Search,
> Google Images, Google News, Google Maps, Google Books, Google Product
> Search, Google Toolbar, iGoogle, and Gmail. She also oversaw the
> layout of Google's well-known, unadorned search homepage. In
> her final years with Google, she was Vice President of Local, Maps,
> and Location Services and, before that, vice president of search
> products and user experience.

Interesting, she about did it all. Now she's CEO of Yahoo! 

## 37Signals (oops, I mean Basecamp) Specializes in...

DHH wrote a [blog post] on specialization recently where he makes the point
that too much specialization is a bad thing.

> Specialization might give you a temporary boost in productivity, but
> it comes at the expense of overall functional cohesion and shared
> ownership.

He also makes the point that good programmers are good programmers and
good designers are good designers...regardless of what technology
they're using.

## Summary

I'm not going to be too eager to specialize in anything just yet.  I
enjoy helping clients and offering them an opinion that that isn't
limited to one technology.  Of course, you can't be everything to
everybody, so there is some relativity here, but in my arena, it's being
able to take a web app from start to finish: concept, planning, project
management, design, development, deployment and support.  One of my
favorite parts of my job is learning, improving and exploring.
Specialization doesn't eliminate that, but it definitely narrows the
scope.
