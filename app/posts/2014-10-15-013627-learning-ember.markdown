Recently I've been working on a new product for my company and I decided
it was a good fit for [Ember][]. I'm just now learning Ember so it's a
new endeavor for me.

I got about 60% of the way through the project and hit somewhat of a
wall. I've gone about as far as the introduction tutorials I've found
take you. 

I've been pretty comfortable in my role as a senior or advanced rails
developer for some time now. Not that I don't struggle or work on hard
problems, but rails as a framework isn't getting in my way or slowing me
down. I'm able to focus on my problems and not focus on the framework.

Now that I'm learning ember, I'm reminded of back when I was learning
rails and how difficult and frustrating it can be to learn something new.
To solve a simple problem, it requires a lot of digging and learning. But
that's the price you pay for learning a framework. In a recent talk I
gave about learning rails, I explained that it was difficult to learn
rails (or any framework for that matter), but that the investment was
well worth it. 

I spent about 10-15 minutes live coding with them went through doing a
quick prototype of their website. I saw some pretty impressed smiles
from the crowd when they saw rails work it's magic. 

I struggle with this upfront cost, but have to take some of my own
medicine every now and then remember that it's worth it in the long run.
