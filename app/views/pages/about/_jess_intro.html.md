I've wanted to be an entrepreneur as long as I can remember.  I finally
got a chance to start a business in 2008 when my wife finally said OK.
We started Brown Web Design, a web design and development consultancy.
It's been quite an experience since those early years. 

Since then much has changed, but, then again, nothing has changed. I've
hired another developer, I've shifted from doing standard marketing
websites to developing software applications in ruby and rails, I've
accumulated the knowledge of learning at least one thing new each day,
I've gone from being a green horn to being an experienced professional,
contributed to major open source projects, developed my own SaaS
product, and have spoken and written about developing software
applications. 

However, the thing that has stayed the same is that I still am just
simply focused on helping people. When I first started, I'd help anyone
do whatever I could--from helping someone setup their email to adding an
image to a website.  Now I still help people, we're just solving much
more complicated problems with cloud-based software.

I have a BBA in Finance, sales and marketing experience, and have lead
small organizations and companies, but I've never had any education in
Computer Science.  When I first started, I knew I wasn't and never would
be the best programmer or designer, but I believed that if I listened to
people, communicated open and effectively, and focused on helping them
solve their problems, I'd be successful. 

Here's a few examples of what I've been up to lately:
